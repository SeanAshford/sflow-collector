# sflow-collector

sFlow is layer 2 packet summerization protocol intended for developing metrics for system behavior and performance. sFlow transmitters are common on Network Appliances and can be run as services on Linux and Windows hosts.

## Overview

The sflow-collector provides a simple sample collector and a class which will parse the sFlow data and return it to the collector for presentation. 

The code has been refactored from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6

The sFlow Collector is using Camel Case instead of Snake Case for historical reasons.

This is a work in progess.
